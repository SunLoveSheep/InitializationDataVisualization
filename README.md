# InitializationDataVisualization

Here contains some codes for building visualizations for data from my initialization study. 

Dashboard part is a dashboard created by R for showing the sensitivity of initial solutions on different functions.

GuidedInitialization part is a R script that read .csv files from a given path, draw plots based on mean, std results from all cases, output the plot to a specified path. Also draw bar plots for comparisons among different cases on certain function.
